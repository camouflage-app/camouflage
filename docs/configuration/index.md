# Camouflage Configuration

Camouflage is highly configurable through a simple **JSON config file**. The configuration differs slightly between **HTTP** and **gRPC**, but they share a similar structure for logging, mocks directory, and runtime options.

- [HTTP Configuration](/configuration/http)
- [gRPC Configuration](/configuration/grpc)
