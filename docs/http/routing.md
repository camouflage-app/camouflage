# HTTP - Routing

Camouflage follows a file-based routing system. The way you create certain folders and files in your `mocksDir` determines which API endpoints are generated by Camouflage.

You begin by specifying a directory in your `config.json` that contains all your mocks.

```json
{
  // Other options
  "mocksDir": "./mocks"
}
```

Now you can create folders and files using the request path and the request method of your desired API. Below are some examples of APIs translated into the necessary folders and files.

#### GET Request to /hello/world

- Create a set of folders: `mocks/hello/world`
- Create a `GET.mock` file inside this folder

```
mocks/
    hello/
        world/
            GET.mock
```

#### POST Request to /users

- Create a set of folders: `mocks/users`
- Create a `POST.mock` file inside this folder

```
mocks/
    users/
        POST.mock
```

#### GET Request to /user/:userId/wallet/:walletId

- Create a set of folders: `mocks/user/{userId}/wallet/{walletId}`
- Create a `GET.mock` file inside this folder

```
mocks/
    user/
        {userId}/
            wallet/
                {walletId}/
                    GET.mock
```

> [!TIP]
> As you can see in the example above, dynamic path parameters can be created by naming the relevant folders as `{paramName}`.
> This parameter will be available in your mock files as `request.params.userId`.
> In the next section, when we learn how to write mock files, we'll see how we can use these parameters.
