# HTTP - Routing

Camouflage follows a file based routing system. The way you create certain folders and files in your `mocksDir`, would determine what API endpoints would be generated by Camouflage.

You begin by specifying a directory in your `config.json` which contains all your mocks.

```json
{
  // Other options
  "mocksDir": "./mocks"
}
```

Now you can create folders and files using the request path and the request method of your desired API. Below are some examples of APIs, translated to the necessary folders and files.

#### GET Request to /hello/world

- Create a set of folders as `mocks/hello/world`
- Create a `GET.mock` file under this folder

```
mocks/
    hello/
        world/
            GET.mock
```

#### POST Request to /users

- Create a set of folders as `mocks/users`
- Create a `POST.mock` file under this folder

```
mocks/
    users/
        POST.mock
```

#### GET Request to /user/:userId/wallet/:walletId

- Create a set of folders as `mocks/user/{userId}/wallet/{walletId}`
- Create a `GET.mock` file under this folder

```
mocks/
    user/
        {userId}/
            wallet/
                {walletId}/
                    GET.mock
```

> [!TIP]
> As you can see in the example above, the dynamic path parameters can be created by name the relevant folders as {paramName}.
> This parameter will be available in your mocks files as `request.params.userId`.
> In the next section, when we learn how to write mock files, we'll see how can we use these parameters
